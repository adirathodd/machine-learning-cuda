# Intro to Machine Learning

## Overview
In this repository, I will implement and experiment with fundamental machine learning algorithms. My goal is to deepen my understanding of these techniques while showcasing my skills in parallel computing using CUDA C and C++.

## Projects

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The first project in this repository is an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. This project demonstrates the core principles of supervised learning and provides an opportunity to integrate parallel computing concepts for enhanced performance.
