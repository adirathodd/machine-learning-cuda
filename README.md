# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch with CUDA

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms written from scratch in C++ and parallelized using NVIDIA CUDA. The goal is to deepen understanding of machine learning techniques and GPU programming.

## Features

- Pure C++ implementations without external machine learning libraries
- GPU-accelerated algorithms with CUDA kernels
